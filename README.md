# ManySecured
The ManySecured project’s aims are to protect consumers, organisations and industry from the security risks posed by the Internet of Things (IoT) through best practice and ‘smart’ control at the router/gateway. See ManySecured project (https://manysecured.net/) for more details and the Whitepapers under the resources tab.

This Repository is operated by the IoTSF (https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/) on behalf of the ManySecured project. At a later date this repo will contain copies of draft versions of ManySecured documents to encourage discussion across the wider IoT security community. These can found on the manysecured.net website at https://specs.manysecured.net .

Please note that no license is granted for the work contained in this repo and all items remain under exclusive copyright. At present, to edit the draft documents you will need to agree to the Membership Agreement of the ManySecured Special Interest Group (MS SIG) (https://manysecured.net/manysecured-special-interest-group/).
